# hyperspectral-mycotoxin-detection
ðŸš€ Hyperspectral ML for Mycotoxin Prediction  This project predicts DON (vomitoxin) concentration in corn using hyperspectral imaging data and machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, PCA, t-SNE, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score. Completed for a ML Internship at ImagoAI.
